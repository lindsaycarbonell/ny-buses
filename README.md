# School Bus Breakdowns in New York
How bus delays/breakdowns are affecting the student population of our coverage area, especially in what we could call “preventable” delays, like maintenance issues/accidents.

## Quick Numbers
- **42,980**: total accidents caused by mechanical problems, won't start, problem run

## Datasets that we have
- Information on transportation routes and schools associated with them by name
- Information on bus delays and breakdowns in diff categories by route number

## Questions
- Are there bus lines that are associated with more delays, esp in our coverage area?
- What makes students have attendance issues? Are those measurable?
- Are there any schools near each other that have disparate attendance rates?
- What is the bronx_attendance/ny_attendance vs. bronx_enroll/ny_enroll?

- How is the school compensating for those delays?
- Are the students missing free breakfast by being late?
- How late are these students actually being?
- Who is the company that has a really great record?
